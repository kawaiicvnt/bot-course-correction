# PoC - Dual Wheel, Single Axis, Course Correction.

This repo, consists of three main areas:
- v1: microbit-v1 remote-controller code that I use to control the robot-controller
- v2: microbit-v2 robot-controller code
- fz: flipper zero applet that I use for collecting data from the robot, since it has BLE and a shiny microSD card slot :3

Should I overcome my depression plateu I'll update this README properly.
